sudo apt-get install ant
mkdir build
cd build

If cmake says it can't find the JNI, try running it with sudo su, and making:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64

And then:
cmake -dwith_cuda=off -dwith_ffmpeg=off -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/opencv2410 .. #install prefix needed if installing two opencv's in the same machine (like server and proxy...)

make
sudo make install

This one worked by finding each file individually. Can't hurt to try if the above doesn't:

sudo cmake -dwith_cuda=off -dwith_ffmpeg=off 			\
-DJAVA_AWT_LIBRARY=`dirname \`locate -l1 libawt.so\`` 	\
-DJAVA_INCLUDE_PATH=`dirname \`locate -l1 jni.h\`` 		\
-DJAVA_AWT_INCLUDE_PATH=`dirname \`locate -l1 jawt.h\`` \
-DJAVA_INCLUDE_PATH2=`dirname \`locate -l1 jni_md.h\`` 	\
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/opencv2410 			\
..
